<h1>FMC League S4</h1>
    <p>1.3: <u>28.</u> I should have: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>noticed a 4move eo gave instant jzp</li>
            <li>nissed a 1-move reduction to 4b2 4e</li>
            <li>noticed a 1-move reduction to 2c3 2e on the inverse of the 13 move dr I found</li>
          </ul> 
        I need to learn 4c6e setups and niss my rzps more accurately. And check more at the start.
    </p>
    <p>2.1: <u>24.</u> I got optimal on the DR I found. I should have: <br>
      <ul>
          <li>spent slightly less time on this DR. After finding the 24 at 35 mins, keep searching for rzp in 5s.</li>
          <li>at least searched fully for rzp in 4.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul> 
      I kind of get how 4c6e works now.
  </p>
  <p>2.2: <u>DNF (26).</u> Found a leave slice in 26 early on. I should have<br>
    <ul>
        <li>nissed 1 move to 4b2 4e rather than 3 moves to 0q2e</li>
        <li>Recognized floppy for weird R2F2R2 -6e case</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul> 
    I checked a good amount of starts. Misscrambled a bit. made decent time management in the first  but couldn't solve the DRs. 
</p>
<p>3.1: <u>22</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>found the leave slice that gives 21 but brain farted.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul> 
   
</p>
<p>333fm 16.1: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Didn't check sufficient rzp in 5. Used leave slice that gives 23 but didn't think to insert the E at a U2</li>
      <li>Should learn VR
    </ul> 
      
   
</p>
<p>333fm 16.2: <u>27</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>found the instant rzp that brian used to get a 21. But did the wrong last move of the eo.</li>
      <li>didn't exhaust rzp in 5.</li>
      <li>21 double slice on good axes but +6 smh</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>333fm 16.3: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Misrecognized two 4c4 for 4a2 / 4c3!</li>
      <li>Didn't exhaust rzp in 5. Scramble required more unique EOs.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>3.2: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Found some 4b2 4e jzp variations and switched to inverse, and found wrong slice in 22.</li>
      <li>Didn't exhaust rzp in 5.</li>
      <li>I need to be more organized. </li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>4.3: <u>DNF (26)</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Solved 24 to wrong slice with blocky fish, optimal +2 but couldn't write in time.</li>
      <li>When I have blocky fish leave slice, I should try on a solved cube to ensure I write the correct thing</li>
      <li>I should have seen this DR: U L2 U B2 L now I know to look for this whenever I have the "butterfly" shape.</li>
      <li>When grinding for an "obvious DR" drs started popping up like crazy. Maybe I should really prioritize the obvious stuff.</li>
    </ul>
