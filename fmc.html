<h1>FMC League S4</h1>
    <p>1.3: <u>28.</u> I should have: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>noticed a 4move eo gave instant jzp</li>
            <li>nissed a 1-move reduction to 4b2 4e</li>
            <li>noticed a 1-move reduction to 2c3 2e on the inverse of the 13 move dr I found</li>
          </ul> 
        I need to learn 4c6e setups and niss my rzps more accurately. And check more at the start.
    </p>
    <p>2.1: <u>24.</u> I got optimal on the DR I found. I should have: <br>
      <ul>
          <li>spent slightly less time on this DR. After finding the 24 at 35 mins, keep searching for rzp in 5s.</li>
          <li>at least searched fully for rzp in 4.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul> 
      I kind of get how 4c6e works now.
  </p>
  <p>2.2: <u>DNF (26).</u> Found a leave slice in 26 early on. I should have<br>
    <ul>
        <li>nissed 1 move to 4b2 4e rather than 3 moves to 0q2e</li>
        <li>Recognized floppy for weird R2F2R2 -6e case</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul> 
    I checked a good amount of starts. Misscrambled a bit. made decent time management in the first  but couldn't solve the DRs. 
</p>
<p>3.1: <u>22</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>found the leave slice that gives 21 but brain farted.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul> 
   
</p>
<p>333fm 16.1: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Didn't check sufficient rzp in 5. Used leave slice that gives 23 but didn't think to insert the E at a U2</li>
      <li>Should learn VR
    </ul> 
      
   
</p>
<p>333fm 16.2: <u>27</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>found the instant rzp that brian used to get a 21. But did the wrong last move of the eo.</li>
      <li>didn't exhaust rzp in 5.</li>
      <li>21 double slice on good axes but +6 smh</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>333fm 16.3: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Misrecognized two 4c4 for 4a2 / 4c3!</li>
      <li>Didn't exhaust rzp in 5. Scramble required more unique EOs.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>3.2: <u>24</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Found some 4b2 4e jzp variations and switched to inverse, and found wrong slice in 22.</li>
      <li>Didn't exhaust rzp in 5.</li>
      <li>I need to be more organized. </li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>4.3: <u>DNF (26)</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Solved 24 to wrong slice with blocky fish, optimal +2 but couldn't write in time.</li>
      <li>When I have blocky fish leave slice, I should try on a solved cube to ensure I write the correct thing</li>
      <li>I should have seen this DR: U L2 U B2 L now I know to look for this whenever I have the "butterfly" shape.</li>
      <li>When grinding for an "obvious DR" drs started popping up like crazy. Maybe I should really prioritize the obvious stuff.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>3.3: <u>DNF (25)</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>none of my 6 rzps were any good.</li>
      <li>I ended up switching a variation-eo and found rzp in 5. then switch back for 12 2c3 with 6 variations. </li>
      <li>I should have realized that I needed a 4 move finish for 25slice after swtiching my htr found on inverse. (rare af)</li>
      <li>I should have found more reductions to 4c4e off my other variations, rather than just the first.</li>
      <li>If I see something like dr-3c4e, try two moves to blocky 4c4e</li>
      <li>Sounds like the scramble sucked.</li>
    </ul>  
</p>
<p>4.1: <u>DNF (25)</u>  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>It really was that my four htr-equivalent 11 4b 2es, and four htr-equivalent 10 4b2 4es. All were trash except one which gave 22 opt. </li>
      <li>I should have allotted time for both families.</li>
      <li>I should keep more organized.</li>
      <li>I could've regressed to 3qt and written a gazillion HTRs then just switched the variations</li>
      <li>7 move trigger: If you ever have 4b2 4e trigger (good L's) setup but with parity, turn it into L + square, fix parity, set up L's and you're good.
      </li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>4.2: <u>DNF (26)</u>. My biggest issues right now lie with organization. The moment I find variations of a DR I should check that their differences. I should be also more accurate so as to not rescramble so much. <br>
  <ul>
      <li>11 2c3 4e with variations that I thought were four. </li>
      <li>I switched the 12 move variation before realizing.  should test my variations to ensure they're different before I start solving my dr.</li>
      <li>I should keep more organized.</li>
      <li>I had 11 2c4 I didn't have time to check. </li>
      <li>missed an easy 4 move eo, and another one: F2 R' D B
      </li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>15.1: <u>24</u>. 21 optimal from DR, do a qt to 2c3 4e on the side with the variations, then switch, eh<br>
</p>
<p>333.fm 2025-21 a1: <u>25</u>. Missing these styles of rzp -> dr: R2 U' F2 R:  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>found a DR which gave a 23 but it had bad vibes. Statistically, however, a 24.5 was expected and so I should have tried a couple paths. </li>
      <li>Pleased with my time mana0gement / order of checking things, but often had to rescramble.</li>
      <li>Actually, I started solving my dr way too early lol. But it's at-home solving so it's ok.</li>
      <li>I need to learn arm + pairs, FB U2 R2 FB stuff, more dr trainer, and full eo.</li>
    </ul>  
</p>
<p>333.fm 2025-21 a2: <u>25</u>. missed a 24 off my htr.  <br>
  <ul>
      <li>Didn't check 4c6e despite jzp being nearby.</li>
      <li>missed a 24 from another one of my drs, 4b2 4e with 4q.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>333.fm 2025-21 a3: <u>24</u>.<br>
  <ul>
      <li>Only checked one eo, found the 10 2c3 first thing and tunneled. Statistically I could expect a 23 so it wasn't that bad of a strategy since it wasn't aparently doomed off the bat.</li>
      <li>I missed an equilength dr variation : doing an E2 to the butterfly shape, which gives an easy 23. Now I know.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>333.fm 2025-22 a1: <u>20</u>.<br>
  <ul>
      <li>Unique found 20 of the round, I'm happy.</li>
      <li>Didn't have time to niss any 3-movers.</li>
    </ul>  

</p>
<p>333.fm 2025-22 a1: <u>25</u>.<br>
  <ul>
      <li>Missed the 4 move eo for 21.</li>
    </ul>
