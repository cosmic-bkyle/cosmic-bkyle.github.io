    <p class = "bio">I live in Montreal, Quebec, where I study computer science at McGill University with a minor in math. 
        I'm involved with the Rubik's Cube world, mostly through <a href = "https://cubing.life/about/" class="inline">teaching</a> speedsolving techniques
     and <a href = "https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016KYLE01" class ="inline">competing</a> in the Fewest Moves Challenge. Some of my other interests are 
     computational complexity theory, linguistics, cooking, and skateboarding. </p>
